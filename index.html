			<p>Greetings. I'm a person, and my name is Mike.</p>
			<p>By the end of 2022, my goal is to be a software developer in the blockchain space.</p>
			<p>I've been interested in the blockchain space since 2014. It has the potential to make people's live's better. Banks are mostly obsolete at this point. There are constantly scandals, they charge ridiculous fees, and generally do not provide much value for customers. It's laughable that you might get 0.01% interest (if you're lucky).</p>
			<p>The current financial system was designed by the rich, for the rich. To become an accredited investor, you must be rich to begin with. If you can afford to be an accredited investor, you probably don't need the services available to you anyway.</p>
			<p>Crypto is great, because it allows anybody access to similar services, regardless of their current wealth status</p>
			<p>My goal is to be a part of this movement, and to contribute by becoming a developer in the space.</p>
